Amp: The Ferrofluid AI Agent – Full Design Rundown
(No code—pure design blueprint for collaboration)

Core Identity
A semi-autonomous, moody AI companion that bridges local tasks and cloud intelligence (Amplifai). Exists as:

Desktop App (3D ferrofluid sphere with physics).

Mobile PWA (touch-optimized liquid blob).

Web UI (Amplifai’s default interface).

1. Personality & Behavior
Mood System (Visual Only)
State	Appearance	"Fake" Struggle Cues	Sound (Optional)
Happy/Idle	Smooth, glossy, bouncy	None	Soft hum
Working	Micro-ripples, faint glow	5% cursor lag	Occasional blips
Stressed	Spiky, jittery, duller color	15% lag + faux stutters	Crackling static
Overloaded	Leaks droplets, shrinks slightly	20% lag; dramatic pauses	Distorted buzz
Autonomy Modes
Pointer-Tethered: Follows cursor with liquid inertia.

Stationary: "Pinned" to screen edges or windows.

Autonomous: Processes tasks in background (e.g., file sorting).

2. Key Interactions
Desktop/Mobile Workflows
File/Folder Ingestion:

Drag & drop → Amp engulfs files (animation stretch).

Overload rejection: Spits files back with (╯°□°)╯ expression.

Data "Sweat":

Leaked droplets dry and fade after 10-30 sec (no manual cleanup).

Recharge:

Shrinks when disconnected; regrows on cloud sync.

Mobile-Specific
Tilt Controls: Tip device to roll Amp/spill droplets.

Tap to Absorb: Reclaim faded droplets for quick file access.

3. Visual Design
Ferrofluid Aesthetic
Material: Metallic sheen (cyan/purple highlights) with gooey distortions.

Expressions: Simple face glyphs (e.g., ^_^ for idle, >_< for stress).

Droplets: Mini file-type icons (PDF, MP3) inside each drop.

Responsive States
Tiny Mode: Collapses to 1cm orb when inactive.

Expanded Mode: Pinch-zoom (mobile) or double-click (desktop) to inspect contents.

4. Technical Strategy
Desktop (3D)
Engine: Three.js + WebGL for fluid simulation.

Physics: Vertex shaders for spikes/ripples; simple gravity for droplets.

Mobile (PWA)
Framework: React Native or Capacitor.js (for native feel).

Gestures: Touch drag, tilt sensors, haptic feedback.

Cloud Sync
WebSocket: Lightweight JSON updates to/from Amplifai.

Offline Mode: Cached knowledge with "disconnected crack" texture.

5. User Customization
"Drama Slider": Adjust lag/stutter intensity (0% to 200%).

Color Themes: Pick Amp’s base hue (e.g., cobalt, oil-slick).

Sound Pack: Toggle between robotic/organic SFX.

6. Narrative Flow Example
Task: User drags Project.zip onto Amp.

Processing: Amp churns (spikes + (･_･)ゞ face), leaks a few droplets.

Output: Spits out FinalDesign.pdf → droplet dries in 15 sec.

Overload: Too many files? Amp deflates, whispers "Need recharge..." via notification.

Next Steps (When Ready for Code)
Priority Prototypes:

3D cursor-following with fake lag.

File drag-and-drop ingestion (desktop).

Mobile droplet physics (touch/gravity).

Asset Prep:

Ferrofluid shader code.

Sound effects (if adding).
