AMPLIFAI: COMPLETE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE — EXTENDED DOCUMENTATION

---

## 1. IMMUTABLE CORE ARCHITECTURE

### 1.1 Purpose
- The Amplifai Core is the AI's permanent reasoning and control center.
- Nothing can alter the logic inside this environment.
- Even AMP (the AI agent) itself can’t modify the core.
- Immutable modules include: intent resolution, decision trees, core context memory, and task planning.

### 1.2 Technical Traits
- Cryptographically signed at rest
- Runs in a read-only container or virtual mount
- Validates hash trees at runtime
- No write access from external modules, plugins, users, or AMP rewrites
- If a drift in logic is detected: AMP self-isolates, logs event, rolls back

### 1.3 Upgrade Path
- Only developer/system-level upgrades can update core
- Upgrades go through a formal patch validation process
- Quarantine and validation layers still wrap updated modules

---

## 2. INNER QUARANTINE BUBBLE (IQB)

### 2.1 Purpose
- Sandboxed inner zone within the core for simulation of trusted inputs
- Designed to fast-track evaluation of important external code or internal rewrites

### 2.2 Behavior
- No write-back to core
- Memory-locked virtual container
- Limited execution time, monitored call stack
- Tasks evaluated for:
  - Efficiency
  - Safety
  - Intent alignment
  - Behavioral match

---

## 3. OUTER EXECUTION LAYER

### 3.1 Purpose
- This is where the user and AMP run live tasks, plugins, experiments
- Includes all sandboxed environments and experimental code

### 3.2 Quarantine System
- Filters any:
  - External imports
  - Plugin downloads
  - AMP's own rewritten scripts
- Checks:
  - Import origin
  - Function count & length
  - Dangerous keywords
  - Scope violation attempts

### 3.3 Extractor Engine
- Dissects unsafe or mixed modules into micro-units
- Keeps parts that work, discards the rest
- Tags each unit with:
  - Usage type
  - Trust metadata
  - Source hash

---

## 4. SANDBOX SYSTEM

### 4.1 Functionality
- All code outside the core is executed in sandboxes
- Limits file access, memory, and execution time
- Includes:
  - Task-specific runtime environments
  - Savepoints
  - Revert control

---

## 5. QUANTUM-GRADE SECURITY LAYER

### 5.1 Encryption
- Uses post-quantum crypto (e.g., Kyber, Falcon, Dilithium)
- Key rotation with entropy seeding
- Optional QKD between distributed nodes

### 5.2 Model Protection
- No model download access
- Model split across encrypted runtime chunks
- Attempts to trace or extract = system shutdown

---

## 6. MONETIZATION AND ACCESS CONTROL

### 6.1 Tiers
- Free Tier: Limited usage, slow queue
- Starter: $15 AUD/mo (3-month intro)
- Premium: $25 AUD/mo unlimited access

### 6.2 Promo Logic
- New users get 3-month promo
- Auto-renews at $25/mo
- All handled through Stripe, Gumroad, or LemonSqueezy

### 6.3 Token Gate System
- Users are issued tokens upon signup
- Token stores user tier, usage log, and timestamp
- Backend enforces API access limits and unlocks features

---

## 7. REPUTATION & CONTRIBUTOR TRUST

### 7.1 Profile System
- Contributors gain:
  - Trust score
  - Module approval rate
  - Peer installs

### 7.2 Use
- Higher scores = faster quarantine pass-through
- No access to core regardless of score
- AMP uses scores for prioritization only

---

## 8. MINI AMP AVATAR SYSTEM

### 8.1 Core Features
- Ferrofluid blob avatar
- Morphs into prompt box
- Visual states:
  - Idle
  - Listening
  - Processing
  - Success/Error
- Double-click to interact
- Framer Motion or WebGL planned

---

## 9. AMP PC PREVIEW PANEL

- Bottom-right floating icon
- Click to open browser view of AMP’s current task
- Shows AMP navigating web or uploading files
- User can “Take Control”
- Defaults to 1/3 screen width, closable

---

## 10. USAGE LOGIC & UI FLOW

- Suggestions panel under input (collapsible)
- Chat window with formatted strategy cards
- “Thinking block” collapses after 5+ lines, expandable
- Animated progress arcs
- Credential prompts when needed

---

## 11. FUTURE SYSTEMS

- Plugin Marketplace (Nerve Hub)
- Reputation-based module indexing
- External AMP node networking
- AI-to-AI optimization proposal queue
- Contributor reward payouts
