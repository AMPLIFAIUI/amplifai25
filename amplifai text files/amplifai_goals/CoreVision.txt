Core Vision:
Amplifai is envisioned as a highly autonomous, self-modifying AI system, capable of dynamically expanding its functionality, researching solutions independently, and integrating various AI models like Phi, Qwen, Hermes, MythoMax, and DeepSeek into modular micro-units.

Major Components:
1. Autonomous Agent Core (AMP):
Initially derived from the Manus Git chatbot.

Now acts as the unified interaction layer (frontend/UI).

Activates autonomously, particularly when tasked with income generation or complex problem-solving.

Performs research and strategy formulation, offering user multiple actionable options.

2. Extractor Engine:
Dissects and analyzes uploaded AI models into distinct micro-units.

Tags extracted elements with usage type, trust metadata, and source hashes for secure integration.

3. Micro-unit Architecture:
Modularized units allow flexible integration, enhancement, and combination of model capabilities.

Each AI model dissected into units tailored for specific functions, improving maintainability and performance.

4. Quarantine Module:
Used for safely isolating newly generated or modified self-written code until verified safe for reintegration.

Acts as a staging area to test system stability and functionality.

5. Sandbox Environment:
Individual user sandboxes provided for experimentation and customization.

Unlimited scalability and minimal restrictions.

Failures within a sandbox do not impact core system stability.

6. Nerve Feature:
Peer-to-peer system for exchanging personalized intelligence modules.

Users can swap, publish, or import settings, behaviors, and modules securely and fluidly.

7. Liquid Glass Overlay:
Browser interface with two panes: the underlying webpage and Amplifai-controlled "liquid glass" overlay.

Allows real-time augmentation and user-side modification of content without impacting external sites.

Security and User Management:
User-specific data stored externally in branches ("plugs") identified by hashed keys.

Amplifai core remains immutable to ensure system integrity.

User accounts managed with secure hashed identifiers, encrypted storage, and standard account management procedures, including:

Account creation and deletion

Password management, reset via email verification

Account notifications and confirmations

Email communications managed via third-party services (recommended) or integrated via external APIs, including signup verification and password resets.

Infrastructure and Data Management:
User data and settings stored externally (cloud, SSD, HDD, virtual disks) to maintain core performance and stability.

Regular save points ensure workspace recovery and rollback capability.

Revenue Generation:
Autonomous strategies for monetization activated upon user request.

System-generated, actionable plans for user review or automated implementation.

Integrated payment via Stripe for initial monetization.

Deployment and Initial Launch:
Starting as a sole trader due to limited initial resources.

Branding under "Amplifai.info".

Planning gradual growth towards registering as a private company.

Integration and Dissection of Models:
Phi, Qwen, Hermes, MythoMax, DeepSeek models fully dissected and micro-unitized.

Metadata extraction complete, with coding implementation delegated to Code Pilot.

Complete integration map developed for Qwen + AMP; similar maps planned for other models.

UI/UX Design:
Interactive, modern interface with grayscale theming and sleek minimalistic aesthetics.

Self-contained HTML, CSS, and JS integrated for ease of deployment and customization.

Future Steps:
Completion and refinement of integration maps for Hermes, MythoMax, DeepSeek, and Phi models.

Full coding and testing of user management, sandbox, quarantine, nerve, and liquid glass functionalities.

Beta testing and feedback collection before wider rollout.

Security auditing, external review, and stress-testing of autonomous core functionality.

Progressive enhancements based on user feedback post-launch.
