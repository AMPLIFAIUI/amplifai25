i want to make this an AI website chat , greyscale background, darker grey accented pop out panel etc.  hover pop out panel on the left side with new chat, previous chats, settings icon, login icon etc, when settings is clicked it will overlay the panel with all the settings like light/dark mode slide toggle, incognito slide toggle, an option to choose up to like 5 colour themes, i want users to be able to highlight and query any text on the screen like you have here, and also because it will remember previuos chat windows and conversations, users be able to go back to that previous chat and highlight and right click to add to curent chat window
the site and project name is 'Amplifai' and the chat ai is named 'Amp'. same style text input as here that im typing in, with a paper plane send button, a paperclip icon for attachments.. it will be a 1gb upload limit of any source, folders, files and a huge array of file extensions wil be able to be attached, there dhould be an ellypsis in the top right corner of the page that allows users to linke google drive etc. Amp can read and follow links too. so if a link is posted, a secondary overlay page will appear for the user to navigate on for whatever reason
