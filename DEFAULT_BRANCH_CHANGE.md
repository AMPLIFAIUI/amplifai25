# Default Branch Change: main → master

## Changes Made

This PR prepares the repository for changing the default branch from `main` to `master` by ensuring both branches have identical content.

### What was done:

1. **Content Synchronization**: Merged all content from the `master` branch into the `main` branch
   - The `main` branch previously had only 2 files (LICENSE, README.md)
   - The `master` branch contained the complete project with 61+ files
   - After merge, both branches now have identical content

2. **README Update**: Resolved merge conflicts by keeping the comprehensive README from master branch that includes:
   - Complete project documentation
   - Setup instructions for embedded Python
   - Usage guidelines
   - Development information

3. **Verification**: Confirmed no hardcoded references to `main` branch exist in the codebase

## Next Steps (Manual Repository Administration Required)

To complete the default branch change, a repository administrator must:

### 1. Change Default Branch in GitHub Settings

1. Go to repository Settings → Branches
2. Under "Default branch", click the pencil icon
3. Select `master` from the dropdown
4. Click "Update"
5. Confirm the change

### 2. Optional: Update Branch Protection Rules

If there are branch protection rules on `main`, consider:
- Moving them to `master` branch
- Or removing them from `main` if no longer needed

### 3. Update Local Git Configurations (For Developers)

Developers should update their local repositories:

```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Switch to master branch
git checkout master

# Update local default branch (optional)
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/master

# Delete local main branch if desired
git branch -d main
```

## Impact Assessment

- **No Breaking Changes**: Since both branches now have identical content, switching the default will not break any existing functionality
- **URLs**: GitHub URLs pointing to files will automatically redirect from main to master
- **Clone Behavior**: New clones will default to master branch instead of main
- **CI/CD**: No workflow files were found that reference the main branch
- **Dependencies**: No package.json or other config files reference GitHub URLs with main branch

## Verification

After the default branch change, verify:
- [ ] New clones default to master branch
- [ ] All project functionality works as expected
- [ ] Documentation and setup scripts work correctly
- [ ] No broken links or references

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the change can be reverted by:
1. Going to Settings → Branches
2. Changing the default branch back to `main`
3. Both branches have identical content, so no data loss will occur
